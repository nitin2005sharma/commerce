# Feature Status Report

As of April 6, 2026, this report reflects what is actually verified in the current local workspace, not just what is implemented in code.

## Status Legend

- `Working`: verified directly in this workspace
- `Partially working`: significant parts work, but the full flow is not verified or is blocked mid-way
- `Implemented but not fully verified`: code and routes exist, but the feature was not exercised end to end
- `Blocked by environment/integration`: cannot be fully tested locally until infrastructure or third-party setup is available

## 1. Working

### 1.1 Frontend build

Status: `Working`

What was verified:

- `src/client` builds successfully with `npm run build`
- the build currently generates storefront, support, goals, shared-cart, order, and admin dashboard routes

Important note:

- this build currently skips linting and type validation, so a passing build does not prove those checks are clean

### 1.2 Backend TypeScript build

Status: `Working`

What was verified:

- `src/server` builds successfully with `npm run build`

What this means:

- the backend code compiles into `dist`
- it does not automatically mean the backend can boot successfully in the current local environment

### 1.3 Chat and WebRTC signaling layer

Status: `Working`

What was verified directly:

- two socket clients can connect to the server-side `SocketManager`
- both clients can join the same chat room
- typing indicators are delivered
- `callOffer` and `callAnswer` events are delivered
- ICE candidates are delivered in both directions
- `callEnded` is delivered

Representative implementation paths:

- `src/server/src/infra/socket/socket.ts`
- `src/client/app/(private)/(chat)/useSocketConnection.ts`
- `src/client/app/(private)/(chat)/useChatMessages.ts`
- `src/client/app/(private)/(chat)/useWebRTCCall.ts`

## 2. Partially Working

### 2.1 Backend runtime

Status: `Partially working`

What was verified:

- `npm start` currently fails unless `NODE_ENV=production` is set
- without `NODE_ENV=production`, module alias resolution points at `src` instead of `dist` and throws:
  - `Cannot find module ... src/infra/winston/logger`
- with `NODE_ENV=production`, the server starts bootstrapping, connects to Redis, then fails on Prisma initialization because the local database does not exist:
  - `PrismaClientInitializationError: Database 'ss_commerce' does not exist`

What this means:

- the built server is close to runnable
- the current local environment still prevents full end-to-end testing

### 2.2 Real-time support chat

Status: `Partially working`

What is in place:

- chat UI pages exist for users and admins
- chat API slices and backend chat modules exist
- real-time socket delivery is working

What is not fully verified:

- persisted message creation, retrieval, and full support-chat flow against the real backend database

Why it is only partial:

- the local backend cannot fully boot against the configured database yet

Representative implementation paths:

- `src/client/app/(private)/support/page.tsx`
- `src/client/app/(private)/dashboard/chats/page.tsx`
- `src/client/app/store/apis/ChatApi.ts`
- `src/server/src/modules/chat/chat.service.ts`
- `src/server/src/modules/chat/chat.routes.ts`

### 2.3 WebRTC calling

Status: `Partially working`

What is verified:

- signaling works through Socket.IO
- the call UI and client-side call state wiring are present

What is not verified yet:

- a full browser-to-browser live audio/video session using real camera and microphone devices

Why it is only partial:

- signaling success is necessary, but not sufficient to prove a complete user-facing WebRTC calling experience

## 3. Implemented But Not Fully Verified End To End

### 3.1 Authentication

Status: `Implemented but not fully verified`

Implemented capabilities:

- sign up
- sign in
- sign out
- refresh token flow
- forgot password
- reset password
- Google login
- Facebook login
- Twitter login

Representative implementation path:

- `src/server/src/modules/auth/auth.routes.ts`

Why not fully verified:

- social login requires working provider credentials and redirect configuration
- the full auth flow was not exercised end to end in the current workspace

### 3.2 Storefront, catalog, and admin data management

Status: `Implemented but not fully verified`

Implemented areas:

- product listing and product detail pages
- categories, attributes, variants, reviews, inventory, and dashboard management pages

Representative implementation paths:

- `src/server/src/modules/product`
- `src/server/src/modules/category`
- `src/server/src/modules/attribute`
- `src/server/src/modules/variant`
- `src/server/src/modules/review`
- `src/client/app/(public)/shop/page.tsx`
- `src/client/app/(private)/dashboard`

Why not fully verified:

- the UI builds and the modules exist, but these flows were not run against a healthy local backend and seeded database

### 3.3 Cart, checkout, payments, and orders

Status: `Implemented but not fully verified`

Implemented areas:

- cart management
- checkout attempt tracking
- checkout recovery
- development checkout flow
- Stripe checkout session flow
- order, payment, shipment, and transaction creation

Representative implementation paths:

- `src/server/src/modules/cart`
- `src/server/src/modules/checkout/checkout.service.ts`
- `src/server/src/modules/order`
- `src/server/src/modules/payment`
- `src/server/src/modules/shipment`
- `src/server/src/modules/transaction`

Why not fully verified:

- the backend cannot currently complete local startup against the configured database
- Stripe checkout and webhook behavior depend on valid external configuration

### 3.4 Shared cart collaboration

Status: `Implemented but not fully verified`

Implemented areas:

- shared cart creation
- join-by-code flow
- shared members, votes, and notes
- real-time shared cart room updates

Representative implementation paths:

- `src/server/src/modules/shared-cart/shared-cart.service.ts`
- `src/client/app/(public)/cart/share/[code]/page.tsx`

Why not fully verified:

- the code is present, but a full multi-user browser test was not completed in the current environment

### 3.5 Goal-based bundle builder

Status: `Implemented but not fully verified`

Implemented areas:

- goal templates
- step-based bundle generation
- budget allocation and fallback keyword logic

Representative implementation paths:

- `src/server/src/modules/goal/goal.service.ts`
- `src/client/app/(public)/goals/page.tsx`
- `src/client/app/(public)/goals/[slug]/page.tsx`

Why not fully verified:

- the flow depends on live product data and backend availability, and it was not exercised end to end locally

### 3.6 Analytics, reports, logs, and GraphQL

Status: `Implemented but not fully verified`

Implemented areas:

- dashboard analytics pages
- reports module
- logs module
- GraphQL endpoint and resolvers

Representative implementation paths:

- `src/server/src/modules/analytics`
- `src/server/src/modules/reports`
- `src/server/src/modules/logs`
- `src/server/src/graphql`

Why not fully verified:

- these areas usually need seeded or production-like data to validate correctness meaningfully

## 4. Blocked By Environment Or Third-Party Integration

### 4.1 PostgreSQL database

Status: `Blocked by environment/integration`

Current blocker:

- Prisma cannot connect because the configured local database `ss_commerce` does not exist

Impact:

- blocks full backend startup
- blocks persistent chat testing
- blocks cart, checkout, orders, shared-cart, goals, analytics, and most admin data flows

### 4.2 Backend production start script behavior

Status: `Blocked by environment/integration`

Current blocker:

- `src/server/package.json` runs `node dist/server.js`, but alias setup in `src/server/src/server.ts` depends on `NODE_ENV=production`

Impact:

- `npm start` fails in a default local shell unless the environment is set correctly

### 4.3 Stripe

Status: `Blocked by environment/integration`

Current blocker:

- checkout and webhook flows need valid Stripe keys and webhook setup

Impact:

- payment success, cancel, failure, and webhook confirmation paths cannot be fully trusted without integration testing

### 4.4 OAuth providers

Status: `Blocked by environment/integration`

Current blocker:

- Google, Facebook, and Twitter login require valid client credentials and redirect URIs

Impact:

- social auth cannot be confirmed end to end locally without those provider settings

### 4.5 Cloudinary and media handling

Status: `Blocked by environment/integration`

Current blocker:

- media upload flows depend on Cloudinary configuration

Impact:

- attachment-heavy features such as image uploads need environment-backed testing

## 5. Best Short Answer

The application is not in a state where every documented function can be called fully working today in this local environment.

The most accurate current summary is:

- the codebase is broad and feature-rich
- the frontend and backend both compile
- chat and WebRTC signaling are genuinely working
- many major business features are implemented in code
- full end-to-end verification is currently blocked by backend runtime setup and missing local database/integration dependencies

## 6. Recommended Next Verification Order

1. Fix or harden the backend start path so `npm start` does not depend on a missing `NODE_ENV` setting.
2. Create or connect the local PostgreSQL database `ss_commerce`.
3. Run Prisma migrations and seed data.
4. Smoke-test auth, storefront, cart, checkout, orders, and admin CRUD in a browser.
5. Verify persistent support chat end to end with user and admin accounts.
6. Verify a real two-browser WebRTC call with camera and microphone.
7. Verify Stripe webhook and social login flows with real credentials.
